# Classification-with-Iris-Dataset
The Iris data set contains a 3 classes of 50 observations each, where each class is a certain type of Iris plant. The goal of this classification algorithm is to classify each observation into a particular species given the data(dimensions of the plant). I used a decision-tree algorithm from scikit learn.
